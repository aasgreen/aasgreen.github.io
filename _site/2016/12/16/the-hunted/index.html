    <h1>The Hunted</h1>

    <div class="entry">
        <p>I should be working now, but I have that specfic form of ennui that only happens to academics around Christmas time. All of the undergraduates have left campus, and there is a deflated feeling left– all the carbonated energy of the kids rushing out into the world. Without the lifeblood of their energy, the university feels like a dead whale on a beach, a hollow leviathan. The only thing keeping me company is a pnematic hiss from the optical table. Also, it’s Friday
afternoon, so fuck it. I’m going to talk about the B-movie <em>The Hunted</em> instead.</p>

<p>For those of you who don’t know it, <em>The Hunted</em> is a movie that came out in 2003 starring Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Torro. Honestly, it isn’t that great. Probably, the most generous praise I could give is “It’s aight.”. I’m not here to dwell on its flaws.</p>

<p>Mostly, I enjoyed the movie because, as a child and a young teen I was obsessed with nature. I owned every one of <em>Tom Brown’s Field Guides for Wilderness Survival</em>, must-read classics in the genre of Wilderness Survival Handbooks. I also attempted to make my own thatched roof hut and also attempted to make a firedrill. Attempted, because the firedrill kept spinning out of my hands and the thatched roof hunt still stands to this day, unfinished, a testament to, well, something.
Apathy maybe.</p>

<p>Anyway, <em>The Hunted</em> is losely based on one of Tom Brown, of <em>Tom Browns Wilderness Surival</em> fame, adventures where he tracks down a fugitive using the tracking techniques taught to him by a Native elder whose name was Stalking Wolf. That’s just badass.</p>

<p>I would not recommened this movie to most people. It is a gruesomely violent story of PTSD and the cost of war. The first scene looks literally like hell, a blasted firescape with a constant caucaphony of screams and pain. Most would give anything to escape these images and sounds. This is the point, I think. Del Toro’s inability to escape from these first scenes drives him to the primal wilderness of Oregon, yet the gravity of his violence is inescabable and follows him there.
This theme of escape is again highlighted by Tommy Lee Jones, who, as we learn, is also tormented by his past actions. His form of escape is the pristine, snow-blanketed forests of British Columbia. He too, is unable to escape fully and is eventually pulled back from the furthest reaches of the known world (Canada) and has to once again contend with his responsibilities.</p>

<p>This theme of escape is, I think, universal to all of us. Well, maybe just to disullisioned academics who haven’t ever held a real job.</p>

<p>This was, I think, always at the root of my fascination with nature, the desire to disappear into the woods, into a remote cabin in the hills and just live, unbounded by the artificial constraints of modern life. Nature is no panecea, unfortunately. Actually, it kind of sucks. It is hard work and requires a kind of fortitude that 28 years of sleeping on soft beds disqualifies you from.</p>

<p>But it is this nature of escape that I am most curious of. After watching <em>The Hunted</em> it is clear what TLJ and BDT are running from. But what is my excuse? I have no PTSD, or terrible actions in my past. Yet, this desire to escape has always been there for me. The desitation has changed over the years: television, videogames, reddit, yet the desire to <em>run</em> has always been there. David Foster Wallace touches on this in his unfinished novel <em>The Pale King</em> where he
wonders about why we shy away from boredom– those moments where, bereft of content to consume, we are left alone with our thoughts. Now, Wallace, a lifelong depressive had his own reasons to fear the engine of his mind turning inward, but for the rest of us?</p>

<p>We all of us intuitively understand both TLJ and BDT flight to nature, to remoteness. It is why a moment spent sitting by a babbling brook is undefinably more preferable to a moment engaged with the mundainities of modern life, such as standing in a supermarket line.</p>

<p>I am not claiming that <em>The Hunted</em> is a modern allegory for our collective cosumerist PTSD, by the way. But, I do think that it’s themes of the desire to and ineviabilible failure of escape from ourselves/our alienating environments rang true to me. And, it had some pretty sick knife fights.</p>

<p>3/5 stars.</p>
