        Poetry
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2017-01-06T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">06 Jan 2017</time>

    <p>I’ve been trying to make myself a better person lately. For some reason, I am trying to do this by reading poetry. So, like any good Millenial, I googled <em>Best Poetry of All Time</em>. Feeling sure of myself, I went to the library, excited at the thought of being able to recite Whitman or T. S. Eliot at the next party– impressing my peers with my brooding sensitivity.</p>

<p>Then I cracked open <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. I tried to make myself enjoy it, the way I tried with Scotch.  But honestly, I thought it was bad. I just chose random poems to read, and most of them seemed to be about how great America/Democracy is. I just googled <em>Best Walt Whitman Poems</em> to double check that I wasn’t just landing on his stinkers, but no– all of his famous poems are about America.</p>

<p>I think, in context, he has some great imagery and lines. But, maybe it is a different time, or the fact that I’m not American, but I just couldn’t get into it. I get that American’s are proud of their country, but as someone whose always felt a little awkward whenever “I’m Proud To Be An American” comes on during a hockey game, I’m not sure I’m the right audience. I’ve filed <em>Leaves of Grass</em> away under, “Everyone says its great, but I’m not the right audience, so I’ll take their
    word for it.”</p>

<p>Then Eliot. All the poetry blogs said “Read the Wasteland. Trust us. No, really, it will change your life. Cure your flibitous. Make your dick yuuuge. It. Is. The. Greatest. Thing.” All the poetry blogs are full of shit. Again, I think this shows just how uncut out I am for poetry, but it seemed less lucid that the ramblings of a bath salts imbiber. Maybe if I understood the context of it, like one of those Shakespeare primers which ploddingly explains every medieval pun–
    leaving you with the choice of either ignoring the explanation and apprehensively laughing along like you were told a joke in Swedish, or having the quick-inhalation-of-air-through-the-nose as the joke is explained to you.</p>

<p>It just wasn’t interesting to me. And I don’t think it’s because I’m uncultured– I mean, I love The Wire. T. S. Eliot just sucks.</p>

<p>Well then, Adam, why bother at all?</p>

<p>Here are two poems that I actually enjoyed– I’m unsure about copyright, and too lazy to google it, so I’ll just show excerpts:</p>

<p>The first is Robert Frost: Trial By Existence</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Even the bravest that are slain
 Shall not dissemble their surprise
On waking to find valour reign
 Even as on Earth, in paradise
And where they sought without the sword
 Wide fields of asphodel fore'er
To find that the upmost reward
 Of daring should be still to dare
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I just find it a very beautiful meditation on choice. Frost presents us with a scene of souls in Heaven, and they volunteer to go back to Earth, but only after God reads out the life they are volunteering for. I’m unsure why it has stuck with me– it certainly has none of the pounding rhythm of Invictus– but maybe it is has something to do with the quiet nobility of choosing a path for all its flaws.</p>

<p>The second one is from a more modern poet: Terrance Hayes. I haven’t finished the collection yet, <em>Lighthead</em>, is what it is called. A lot of the poems go over my head, but he writes with vivid imagery</p>

<p>“Hieronymus’s thighs shimmered like the wings of a teenage Cockroach beneath his skirt as a bullhorn of sheriff verbs like Stop! Freeze! and Fire! outlined us.”</p>

<p>The poem is called All The Way Live. I’m not sure I understand it, but reading it was vivid and fun.</p>

<p>I think what those two poems have in common is that they both set their own context– they are painting a scene or telling a story that is beautiful apart from the “moral” of the poem. They intrigue you with imagery, set a scene and tell a story. Frost gives you all the tools needed to understand him, and Hayes has a deft enough sense of story that you get carried along even if you don’t neccesarily <em>get it</em>.</p>

<p>In contrast, Whitman assumes you already love America, you were just missing the words needed to express it, and Eliot assumes you have the time, patience and classical education required to piece together his jigsaw puzzle imagery. Both of
them assume you already have the context neccesary to understand them. Of course, the other two poets make assumptions, but Frost I feel is more timeless, dealing mostly with nature and the nature of choice, and Hayes is modern enough that I do have the context to understand him.</p>

<p>Also, I didn’t mention Shel Silverstien because I thought he would go without saying. We all read him as children and he is universally adored.</p>

<p>To sum up: I read some poetry and didn’t like it. Maybe I should just stick to modern poetry and watch the last season of The Wire<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>The reason I haven’t finished it yet, is, despite enjoying it immensely I am at the part where McNulty is starting to fall apart again and it is just so hard to see him start his descent downward after watching him painfully rebuild himself. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

        The Hunted
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2016-12-16T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">16 Dec 2016</time>

    <p>I should be working now, but I have that specfic form of ennui that only happens to academics around Christmas time. All of the undergraduates have left campus, and there is a deflated feeling left– all the carbonated energy of the kids rushing out into the world. Without the lifeblood of their energy, the university feels like a dead whale on a beach, a hollow leviathan. The only thing keeping me company is a pnematic hiss from the optical table. Also, it’s Friday
afternoon, so fuck it. I’m going to talk about the B-movie <em>The Hunted</em> instead.</p>

<p>For those of you who don’t know it, <em>The Hunted</em> is a movie that came out in 2003 starring Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Torro. Honestly, it isn’t that great. Probably, the most generous praise I could give is “It’s aight.”. I’m not here to dwell on its flaws.</p>

<p>Mostly, I enjoyed the movie because, as a child and a young teen I was obsessed with nature. I owned every one of <em>Tom Brown’s Field Guides for Wilderness Survival</em>, must-read classics in the genre of Wilderness Survival Handbooks. I also attempted to make my own thatched roof hut and also attempted to make a firedrill. Attempted, because the firedrill kept spinning out of my hands and the thatched roof hunt still stands to this day, unfinished, a testament to, well, something.
Apathy maybe.</p>

<p>Anyway, <em>The Hunted</em> is losely based on one of Tom Brown, of <em>Tom Browns Wilderness Surival</em> fame, adventures where he tracks down a fugitive using the tracking techniques taught to him by a Native elder whose name was Stalking Wolf. That’s just badass.</p>

<p>I would not recommened this movie to most people. It is a gruesomely violent story of PTSD and the cost of war. The first scene looks literally like hell, a blasted firescape with a constant caucaphony of screams and pain. Most would give anything to escape these images and sounds. This is the point, I think. Del Toro’s inability to escape from these first scenes drives him to the primal wilderness of Oregon, yet the gravity of his violence is inescabable and follows him there.
This theme of escape is again highlighted by Tommy Lee Jones, who, as we learn, is also tormented by his past actions. His form of escape is the pristine, snow-blanketed forests of British Columbia. He too, is unable to escape fully and is eventually pulled back from the furthest reaches of the known world (Canada) and has to once again contend with his responsibilities.</p>

<p>This theme of escape is, I think, universal to all of us. Well, maybe just to disullisioned academics who haven’t ever held a real job.</p>

<p>This was, I think, always at the root of my fascination with nature, the desire to disappear into the woods, into a remote cabin in the hills and just live, unbounded by the artificial constraints of modern life. Nature is no panecea, unfortunately. Actually, it kind of sucks. It is hard work and requires a kind of fortitude that 28 years of sleeping on soft beds disqualifies you from.</p>

<p>But it is this nature of escape that I am most curious of. After watching <em>The Hunted</em> it is clear what TLJ and BDT are running from. But what is my excuse? I have no PTSD, or terrible actions in my past. Yet, this desire to escape has always been there for me. The desitation has changed over the years: television, videogames, reddit, yet the desire to <em>run</em> has always been there. David Foster Wallace touches on this in his unfinished novel <em>The Pale King</em> where he
wonders about why we shy away from boredom– those moments where, bereft of content to consume, we are left alone with our thoughts. Now, Wallace, a lifelong depressive had his own reasons to fear the engine of his mind turning inward, but for the rest of us?</p>

<p>We all of us intuitively understand both TLJ and BDT flight to nature, to remoteness. It is why a moment spent sitting by a babbling brook is undefinably more preferable to a moment engaged with the mundainities of modern life, such as standing in a supermarket line.</p>

<p>I am not claiming that <em>The Hunted</em> is a modern allegory for our collective cosumerist PTSD, by the way. But, I do think that it’s themes of the desire to and ineviabilible failure of escape from ourselves/our alienating environments rang true to me. And, it had some pretty sick knife fights.</p>

<p>3/5 stars.</p>

        Speeding Up Videos with FFMPEG
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2016-03-02T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">02 Mar 2016</time>

    <p>Say you want to speed up or slow down a video on linux. You have a couple of options. You can go with a traditional video editor like OpenShot or Blender, or you can try your luck on the command line. I needed to speed up a video yesterday, and I tried most of these approaches.</p>

<h2 id="open-shot">Open Shot</h2>

<p>Honestly, I don’t think I can use OpenShot. It kept screwing up on me. The 
video preview ceased to work, by that I mean it didn’t play videos anymore. I just couldn’t get it to work consitently.</p>

<h2 id="blender">Blender</h2>

<p>Well. Blender. Someday soon, someone will write a graphics UI so complicated, so dense that someone will write another graphical UI so serve as a user facing layer. It will probably be for Blender. I tried working with it, using a very nice blog post.</p>

<p>You click on a small button on the top which enters you into video editing mode. Then you click on the add button which is hidden amidst the dense foliage of words and icons. Then you add your video. Then you go to ‘strip’ and make a metastrip to combine audio and video. Then you go to strip-addeffects-time or something, and add a time speed up strip. Something something involving keyframes. At this point, I had accidently opened another window, so I minimized it, but
found another window behind that, and tried to minimize it, but there were just more windows. I closed Blender in fear.</p>

<p>I eventually got it to work, but for some reason my sped up video had an additional 5 seconds of darkness added to it. I don’t know why.</p>

<h2 id="mencoder">MENCODER</h2>

<p>I tried using mencoder to speed up a film by a factor of 72, but it completely borked. 
‘’’</p>

<p>mencoder -speed 72 SN004_Thermo_thin\ bubble.wmv -ovc copy -nosound -o output.wmv</p>

<p>’’’</p>

<p>I think what happened was that it had correctly rendered everything, but that meant a framerate of 24 by 72, which is very big and VLC probably has trouble showing me. That’s my guess, as VLC just showed me one frame for ten seconds when I viewed it, BUT, when I manually clicked on different places in the video timeline I could skip to different manual frames.</p>

<h2 id="ffmpeg">FFMPEG</h2>

<p>I have fond memories of ffmpeg. Converting downloaded movies in their .avi format to something that could play on my ipod classic. Getting the aspect ratio right, the formatting. The long line of dense code that I could only understand in the periphery.</p>

<p>Anyway, ffmpeg worked. It was hard actually. Due to a tif in the ubuntu community you can’t actually get real ffmpeg on trusty ubuntu, which is what I am using. So you have to do this sketchy ppa thing, where you ask a dude named micheal to please directly connect to my computer and give me ffmpeg.</p>

<p>I finally got it to work, but I had a lot of difficulty. What was happening was that I would speed up the film, but the duration was being incorrectly reported. So my film would finish in five seconds, but there would be a blank frame playing for 6 more minutes. I originally thought this was because the way ffmpeg speeds up films is by using a weird filter. I don’t understand it, but by changing some metadata flag you can get the frames to display faster, but the actual framerate
doesn’t change. So, I think ffmpeg just drops frames to make it work? But you can force the framerate to change as well, but then I think you end up back with the mencoder problem.</p>

<p>This is the code I used:</p>

<p>’’’
ffmpeg -i SN004_Thermo_thin\ bubble.wmv  -filter:v “setpts=(PTS/10)” output10.wmv</p>

<p>’’’</p>

<p>Anyway, the duration wasn’t being reported right. I finally figured it out though, the audio channel wasn’t being sped up. So, if you add the -an flag, ffmpeg gets rid of the audio channel, and you get the right duration. I didn’t notice, because my original video didn’t have any sound on its audio channel.</p>

<p>So, to correctly speed up a video in ffmpeg, use the following code</p>

<p>’’’</p>

<p>ffmpeg -i SN004_Thermo_thin\ bubble.wmv -an  -filter:v “setpts=(PTS/10)” output10.wmv</p>

<p>’’’</p>

<p>Other blogs can explain the flags to you. I just wanted to note that if you are getting the wrong duration, try disabling your audio channel.</p>

        Rsync

    <time datetime="2015-05-01T00:00:00-06:00" class="post-date">01 May 2015</time>

    <p>So, this is my first blog entry. I’ll be using it basically to take notes on processes that I use frequently, and maybe provide updates to the physics projects that I’m working on.</p>

<p>I am creating very large video and image files, and to work with them, I’ve started using rsync.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rsync --progress -rhzve ssh 'chaneyC@host:"/cygdrive/c/Documents and Settings/chaneyC/My Documents/Adam/man.pdf"' ./
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is a huge pain to get to work, because you need to escape the spaces in the right way. This way works.</p>
