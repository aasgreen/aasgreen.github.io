title: Understanding the Spatial Autocorrelation Series: Part I
summary: Using the spatial autocorrelation to detect features in an images
---

In this post, I am going to motivate and explain the spatial autocorrelation. This post will be useful for getting a basic intuition for this function.

This blog series was inspired because I found the online resources for understanding the spatial autocorrelation to be confusing and sparse. The next post, maybe I'll look at the more *conventional* applications of the spatial autocorrelation, but for now, I really just want to understand: 1. what it is, and 2. how to implement it.
