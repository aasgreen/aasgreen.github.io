So, this is my first blog entry. I'll be using it basically to take notes on processes that I use frequently, and maybe provide updates to the physics projects that I'm working on.


I am creating very large video and image files, and to work with them, I've started using rsync. 

    rsync --progress -rhzve ssh 'chaneyC@host:"/cygdrive/c/Documents and Settings/chaneyC/My Documents/Adam/man.pdf"' ./

It is a huge pain to get to work, because you need to escape the spaces in the right way. This way works.
