title: Machine Learning The XY-Model
summary: An adventure in using machine learning methods to experimentally study the XY model in smectic films

At this point, we're still brining together all of the resources we've already made.

I have a few goals this week:
1. Implement and understand Eric's workflow/YOLO implementation
2. Improve the defect tracking in the simulation data
3. Work through the stanfor machine learning course
