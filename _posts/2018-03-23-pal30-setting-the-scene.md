This is going to be a long post. It took over two years to correctly characterize PAL30. I thought it would be neat to take you through the process, so you can see how science is done in the trenches.

In general, PAL30 is a liquid crystal material (existing nebulously on the spectrum between solid crystal and fluid liquid). The challenge is to characterize it: find out exactly how it is organized on the molecular level. This is important, not just for the warm glow scientists get when they understand the world just a *little* more completely, but because the way the molecules organize (what we call its *phase*) can lead to many interesting and useful properties. For instance, unless
you have the newer Iphones, your smartphone screen is made using LCDs-- liquid crystal displays--, and LCDs work because of the specific properties of the liquid crystal phase.[^1] 

[^1]: I don't want to mislead you. The chances of discovering a new phase with display applications, especially as all the big players are moving to OLEDs anyway, are pretty minimal. It is mostly about that warm glow of scientific discovery.


Like any good saga, ours begins with the introduction of the monster, PAL30 itself.

But to a physicist, the above chemical just looks like:
![PAL30 Bananna Structure](/assets/pal30/bananna.jpg){:class='img-responsive'}
and for the most part, we can get away with this.

The bananna structure is already suggestive of the phase-- if you've ever seen a bunch of banannas, you know that they tend to all want to point along the same direction-- the same for these bananna molecules. Several of the most common bananna phases are shown below.

One thing that makes these phases interesting is that they are intrinsically polar-- so they try to reorient in the direction of applied fields. You can get an idea of why this is because of the 'kink' in the middle. This kink means that there are more electrons in the middle, so that each molecule has a little dipole built in.

Now, these phases attracted some interest in the 90's as a potential new display was being developed (the FLC display). The display ended up not really working[^2], but not before 'bananna mania' had swept through the liquid crystal community. [^2]: I think it ran into problems with scaling from prototype to an actual product. It was a pretty finicky technology.

PAL30 rears its head in 2011, when scientists published a paper in *Physical Review Letters* describing something that had never been seen before: a phase sequence of completely orthogonal phases!

It is only on closer inspection that the monstrous nature of PAL30 is revealed...


In my next post, I'll explain what an orthogonal phase is and why it is important, and then give a few more details on the above PRL. Till next time!
