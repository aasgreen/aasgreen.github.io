I am a graduate student at University of Colorado at Boulder, where I study the hydrodynamics and properties of ideal 2D fluids. My current work is on the behaviour of topological defects in these systems -- how they are created and annihilated.

I also have a strong interest in applying data driven exploration to issues of social justice. The current project I'm working on tracks public interest in mass-shootings over time.
