I am a recent PhD gradute from the University of Colorado at Boulder, where I studied the hydrodynamics and properties of ideal 2D fluids of liquid crystals. I am trained in both experimental and theory/computational work (and I enjoy both!). My current work is on the behaviour of topological defects in these systems -- how they are created and annihilated. I am using deep learning methods to track these topological defects trajectories as they annhilate at the highest
time-resolution ever (sometimes, deep learning does live up to the hype ;) ).
